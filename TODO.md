## =� Performance Optimization

### Parallel Processing
- [ ] **Worker pool architecture** (configurable workers)
  - [ ] Parallel file processing for multi-file NeTEx archives
  - [ ] Concurrent entity conversion (routes, stops, trips)
  - [ ] Streaming XML processing with worker pools
- [ ] **Memory optimization**
  - [ ] Memory pooling for frequently allocated objects
  - [ ] Streaming processing to handle large datasets
  - [ ] Configurable memory limits with backpressure

### Benchmarking
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** for all conversion operations
- [ ] **Memory profiling** integration
- [ ] **Progress reporting** with callbacks for long-running operations
- [ ] **Cancellation support** via context.Context
